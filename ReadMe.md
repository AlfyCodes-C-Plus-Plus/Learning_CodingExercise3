# Coding Exercise 3

In this exercise you will write code using cin and the extraction operator >> to allow a user to enter their date of birth.

The variable m represents the month, d represents the day, and y represents the year.

Assume that the user will enter their date of birth in the order of month, day, year, with each value being separated by a white space.

You do not need to prompt the user for any information using cout

Our test program will automatically 'pretend' to be the user and enter the values 2 15 and 1993 automatically.

So, your code should consist only of the cin statement(s). NO other code should be necessary.
